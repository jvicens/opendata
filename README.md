## Open Twitter Data

- Twitter Data Processing

We used the Twitter’s search to gather historical tweets and the streaming API to follow specified accounts and also 
collect in real-time tweets that mention specific keywords. To comply with Twitter’s [Terms of Service](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy), 
we are only publicly releasing the tweet IDs of the collected tweets. The data is released for non-commercial research use. 

**With Twitter's changes to its Academic API policies, it’s no longer possible to collect or rehydrate tweets 
as we usually did, however we open data in case at some point it will become feasible to do it.**
